Although non-monotonic interactions and associations are known to increase the stability, diversity, and productivity of ecosystems, they are frequently ignored by community-level standard statistical approaches. Using the copula-based dependence measure qad, capable of quantifying the directed and asymmetric dependence between variables for all forms of (functional) relationships, we determined the proportion of non-monotonic associations between different constituents of an ecosystem (plants, bacteria, fungi, and environmental parameters). Here, we show that up to 59% of all statistically significant associations are non-monotonic. Further, we show that pairwise associations between plants, bacteria, fungi, and environmental parameters are specifically characterized by their strength and degree of monotonicity, for example, microbe–microbe associations are on average stronger than and differ in degree of non-monotonicity from plant–microbe associations. Considering directed and non-monotonic associations, we extended the concept of ecosystem coupling providing more complete insights into the internal order of ecosystems. Our results emphasize the importance of ecological non-monotonicity in characterizing and understanding ecosystem patterns and processes.","tags":["ecosystem coupling","non-monotonic","qad","microbiome","community assembly","biodiversity","ecology","plants","microbes"],"title":"Exploring the Frequency and Distribution of Ecological Non-monotonicity in Associations among Ecosystem Constituents","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Maximilian Hanusch"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1688756576,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1688756576,"objectID":"697711ae55e43124ec73e72e22d9090d","permalink":"https://maxhanusch.github.io/project/biotopverbund/","publishdate":"2023-07-07T21:02:56+02:00","relpermalink":"/project/biotopverbund/","section":"project","summary":"The habitat network enables animal and plant species to move through the landscape, facilitating the exchange between ecologically valuable areas.","tags":["connectivity conservation"],"title":"Connectivity Conservation Bavaria","type":"project"},{"authors":["Maximilian Hanusch"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1677110400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1677110400,"objectID":"2b67cd71c1a356b86a899c6314c75ca8","permalink":"https://maxhanusch.github.io/talk/vilm_2023/","publishdate":"2021-08-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/vilm_2023/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"OECMs as an important tool to improve landscape connectivity in Bavaria/Germany","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Xie He","**Maximilian Hanusch**","Victoria Ruiz-Hernández","Robert R.

These glacier forefields serve as an ideal ecosystem for studying transformations in community composition and diversity over time and the interactions between taxonomic groups in a dynamic landscape. In this study, we investigated the relationships between the composition and diversity of bacteria, fungi, and plant communities as well as environmental factors along a successional gradient. We used random forest analysis assessing how well the composition and diversity of taxonomic groups and environmental factors mutually predict each other. We did not identify a single best indicator for all taxonomic and environmental properties, but found specific predictors to be most accurate for each taxon and environmental factor. The accuracy of prediction varied considerably along the successional gradient, highlighting the dynamic environmental conditions along the successional gradient that may also affect biotic interactions across taxa. This was also reflected by the high accuracy of predictions of plot age by all taxa. Next to plot age, our results indicate a strong importance of pH and temperature in structuring microbial and plant community composition. In addition, taxonomic groups predicted the community composition of each other more accurately than environmental factors, which may either suggest that these groups similarly respond to other not measured environmental factors or that direct interactions between taxa shape the composition of their communities. In contrast, diversity of taxa was not well predicted, suggesting that community composition of one taxonomic group is not a strong driver of the diversity of another group. Our study provides insights into the successional development of multidiverse communities shaped by complex interactions between taxonomic groups and the environment.","tags":["ecosystem complexity","microbes","bacteria","fungi","ecology","interactions","plants","random forest","ödenwinkel"],"title":"Accuracy of mutual predictions of plant and microbial communities vary along a successional gradient in an alpine glacier forefield","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Maximilian Hanusch**","Xie He","Victoria Ruiz-Hernández","Robert R.

Among animals, most research has focused on a few well-studied taxa, such as birds or butterflies. For other species, progress is limited by the paucity of data. We used species occurrence data for 11 taxa and 23 German cities from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) and the different German states, in a 50-km buffer around the city centre, to investigate what proportion of species of the regional species pools also occur in cities. While data could be obtained for all cities from GBIF, state databases only provided data for a subset of cities. Sample coverage of data from GBIF was higher across all taxa than of the state databases. For each database and taxon, we analysed (i) all cities where the number of occurrences of a taxon was 50 and (ii) only those cities where additionally sample coverage was 0.85. Across all taxa studied on average, 44.9 ± 7.2% (GBIF) and 40.8 ± 9.6% (German states) of the species of the regional species pool were also found in cities. When all cities were considered together, more than 76% of all species occurred within city borders. Our results show that German cities harbour a large part of the regional diversity of different taxa when city borders rather than the city centre is considered. This opens up ample opportunities for conservation and for fostering human–nature relationships.","tags":["urban ecology","GIS","spatial analyis","biodiversity","species pool","animals"],"title":"Data from public and governmental databases show that a large proportion of the regional animal species pool occur in cities in Germany","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Robert R.

A direct comparison between the assembly of microbial and ‘macrobial’ organisms is hampered by the sampling of these communities in different studies, at different sites or on different scales. In a glacier forefield in the Austrian Alps, we recorded the soil and plant microbiome (bacteria and fungi) and plants that occurred in the same landscape and in close proximity in the same plots. We tested five predictions deduced from assembly processes and revealed deviating patterns of assembly in these community types. In short, microbes appeared to be less dispersal limited than plants and soil microbes, and plants strongly responded to abiotic factors whereas the leaf microbiome was plant species specific and well buffered from environmental conditions. The observed differences in community assembly processes may be attributed to the organisms’ dispersal abilities, the exposure of the habitats to airborne propagules and habitat characteristics. The finding that assembly is conditional to the characteristics of the organisms, the habitat and the spatial scale under consideration is thus central for our understanding about the establishment and the maintenance of biodiversity.","tags":["ecosystem complexity","microbiome","community assembly","biodiversity","ecology","interactions","plants","microbes"],"title":"Divergent assembly processes?

In a second step, we reconstructed the historical biogeography of the genus. We found thatEpipterygium mostlikely originated in Asia or North/Central America andthat thealleged singlewidespread species E. tozeri with disjunctranges is in fact a group of genetically and morphologically distinct taxa, including four overlooked species, for which we provide descrip-tions: E. atlanticum sp. nov., E. biauritum sp. no v., E. oreophilum sp. no v., and E. yunnanense sp. nov.

Reports on ecological successions are however mostly restricted to one or two taxonomic groups, neglecting the mutual influences and dependencies between multiple taxonomic groups that are the building blocks of diverse communities. We introduce the Alpine research platform Ödenwinkel to promote observational and experimental research on the emergence of multidiversity and ecosystem complexity. We established n= 140 permanent plots along the successional gradient of the forefield of the Ödenwinkelkees glacier at the end of the Stubachtal valley in the Hohe Tauern range (Hohe Tauern National Park, Land Salzburg, Austria). In summer 2019 we completed a first full inventory of biotic and abiotic characteristics of these plots covering the diversity and composition of vascular plants, bryophytes, arthropods, and other animals, bacteria and fungi as well as some geomorphologic properties. In this paper we introduce the design of the research platform and show first results. While focusing on the diversity and composition of vascular plants along the successional gradient, we also provide data on the diversity of animals, bacteria, and fungi. The Ödenwinkel platform will be available as a long-term ecological research site where researchers from various disciplines can contribute to the accumulation of knowledge on ecological successions and on how interactions between various taxonomic groups structure ecological complexity in this Alpine environment..","tags":["ecosystem complexity","experiments","observation","biodiversity","ecology","interactions","plants","microbes","animals","bryophytes"],"title":"Ödenwinkel: an Alpine platform for observational and experimental research on the emergence of multidiversity and ecosystem complexity","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Max Hanusch"],"categories":[],"content":" Analyze your running tracks with R This tutorial shows you how to analyse your data that is stored nowadays by many fitness apps.

The dataframe holds information to the geographic coordinates, the elevation and the recording time of each waypoint. We can now already inspect the track.\n#have a first look at the track plot(rev(t$lon), rev(t$lat), type = \u0026quot;l\u0026quot;, col = \u0026quot;tomato\u0026quot;, lwd = 3, bty = \u0026quot;n\u0026quot;, ylab = \u0026quot;Latitude\u0026quot;, xlab = \u0026quot;Longitude\u0026quot;)  \r\r\rWe want to analyse our performance during the run, including the speed and distance. To get this information we calculate the distance and the speed between each waypoint. For this, we use simple loops. The geographic distance between each waypoint and the previous one can be calculated by the geodist package. The command automatically takes the lat and lon coordinates in our dataframe as an input.\n#caluculate the distance of every waypoint to the previous waypoint t$dist.prev\u0026lt;- rep(NA,2772) for (i in seq(1:nrow(t)-1)){ t$dist.prev[i] \u0026lt;- geodist(t,)[i,i+1] }  Our velocity is defined as the rate of change of position with respect to time. So we need to calculate the time passed between the recording of each waypoint and later divide the distance by the time passed.\n# transformation of the time column, so that R can interpret it t$time \u0026lt;- strptime(t$time, format = \u0026quot;%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%OS\u0026quot;) #calculate the differences in time of each waypointto the previous one #we use abs() command to have absolute values, as the differences #would become negative numbers without it t$time.diff\u0026lt;- rep(NA,2772) for (i in seq(1:nrow(t)-1)){ t$time.diff[i] \u0026lt;- abs(as.numeric(difftime(t$time[i], t$time[i+1]))) } #there are some errors in the time measurements where the app #recorded the same time for two points. #This would result infinite values for velocity # so we will get rid of this t$time.diff[t$time.diff == 0]\u0026lt;-1  Now with elapsed time and distance we can calculate speed, smooth it a little and inspect the data. To plot the distance on the x-axis we also calculate the cumulative distance of each waypoint. The black line is the raw velocity between each waypoint. It is very fuzzy and we can reduce the noise in the data by applying the loess smoothing shown by the blue line.\nt$speed.m.per.sec \u0026lt;- t$dist.prev / t$time.diff t$speed.km.per.h \u0026lt;- t$speed.m.per.sec * 3.6 # transofrm to kmh^-1 t$speed.km.per.h[is.na(t$speed.km.per.h)] \u0026lt;-0#last entry converted from NA to 0 ####smooth everything a little using lowess t$loess.speed \u0026lt;- lowess(t$speed.km.per.h, f = 0.1)$y #cumulative distance t$cum.dist\u0026lt;-cumsum(t$dist.prev)  \r\r\rNow with all the data generated, we can plot the track, colorize it according to the velocity and add a basemap to it. This is done using the ggmap package. We use the outer bounds of our waypoint coordinates as the corners of the map and add a little offset to make it look even nicer.\n#get the basemap basemap\u0026lt;- get_map(c(left = min(lon)-0.01, bottom = min(lat)-0.005, right = max(lon)+0.01, top = max(lat)+0.005), source=\u0026quot;osm\u0026quot;, zoom=14) #and plot the map ggmap(basemap) + geom_point(data = t, aes(lon,lat,col = loess.speed), size=2, stroke = 0, alpha=0.7) + labs(x = \u0026quot;Longitude\u0026quot;, y = \u0026quot;Latitude\u0026quot;, title=\u0026quot;Run up Holzer Alm\u0026quot;, col=\u0026quot;Speed [km/h]\u0026quot;) + scale_colour_gradient(high = \u0026quot;red\u0026quot;, low = \u0026quot;green\u0026quot;,)  This time we use a free basemap from OpenStreetMap.

Even though it was already late in the year, we had to start early as the south-exposed trail still becomes a very unpleasant place during the mid-day´s heat.

Current conservation approaches in cities are mostly defensive, by focusing on remnant pockets of natural areas, or by trying to protect particular species where they occur in the built environment. These approaches are vulnerable to further urban development and do not create habitats where these do not exist anymore. An alternative strategy is to make wildlife an integral part of urban development and thereby create new habitat in the built up area. Here we address the challenge of choosing target species for such wildlife-inclusive urban design. The starting point of our conceptual framework is the regional species pool, which can be obtained from geo-referenced species data. The available habitat types on and around the development site, and dispersal barriers limit the species numbers to the local species potential. In the next step, the potential of the site for each species is analyzed – how can it be upgraded to host species given the planned development and the life-history traits of the species? For the final choice of target species, traits related to the human-animal interaction should also be considered. We suggest that stakeholders will be involved in the final species selection. Our approach differs from existing practice by 1) representing an open process where many species are potential targets of conservation, 2) the involvement of stakeholders in a participatory way.","tags":["urban planning","wildlife-inclusive urban design","human-wildlife interactions","biodiversity","urban design","stakeholder participation","geo-referenced species data","GIS"],"title":"A Conceptual Framework for Choosing Target Species for Wildlife-Inclusive Urban Design","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Joachim Bretzel","Theresia Endriß","Franziska Halblinger","**Maximilian Hanusch**","Regina Hege","Iris Krömmüller","Simon Reith","Verena Rupprecht","Michael Sach","Sophia Schwaiger","Veronika Stiglmaier","Nikolas Thum","Julie A.
