Plant species are characterized by specific microbial communities, but the relative contributions of the plants’ phenotype, biotic and abiotic environmental conditions, and dispersal from surrounding habitats to community diversity and composition remain poorly understood. Glacier forefields – large areas of deglaciated substrate, which can be colonized by microorganisms, plants, and animals – provide an excellent opportunity to study several decades of microbial succession over the distance of only a few hundred meters. In order to evaluate the importance of the structuring factors of microbial communities, bacterial and fungal communities of the plant phyllosphere and the soil microbiome, as well as vegetation cover and arthropod communities will be recorded along a temporal gradient spanning over 170 years of microbial primary succession. Additionally, we will test hypotheses generated from field data in microcosm in the lab in order to verify correlational findings in stringent experiments and to gain novel insights into the interdependencies of microorganisms with other taxonomic groups.","tags":[],"title":"Successions of microbes associated with below and above ground plant parts in a glacier fore field","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Max Hanusch"],"categories":[],"content":"When temperatures are falling and the first frosts end the vegetation period in the northern Alps, there is still a lot to discover in the Italian part of the mountain range.

Even though it was already late in the year, we had to start early as the south-exposed trail still becomes a very unpleasant place during the mid-day´s heat.

Current conservation approaches in cities are mostly defensive, by focusing on remnant pockets of natural areas, or by trying to protect particular species where they occur in the built environment. These approaches are vulnerable to further urban development and do not create habitats where these do not exist anymore. An alternative strategy is to make wildlife an integral part of urban development and thereby create new habitat in the built up area. Here we address the challenge of choosing target species for such wildlife-inclusive urban design. The starting point of our conceptual framework is the regional species pool, which can be obtained from geo-referenced species data. The available habitat types on and around the development site, and dispersal barriers limit the species numbers to the local species potential. In the next step, the potential of the site for each species is analyzed – how can it be upgraded to host species given the planned development and the life-history traits of the species? For the final choice of target species, traits related to the human-animal interaction should also be considered. We suggest that stakeholders will be involved in the final species selection. Our approach differs from existing practice by 1) representing an open process where many species are potential targets of conservation, 2) the involvement of stakeholders in a participatory way.","tags":["urban planning","wildlife-inclusive urban design","human-wildlife interactions","biodiversity","urban design","stakeholder participation","geo-referenced species data","GIS"],"title":"A Conceptual Framework for Choosing Target Species for Wildlife-Inclusive Urban Design","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Joachim Bretzel","Theresia Endriß","Franziska Halblinger","Maximilian Hanusch","Regina Hege","Iris Krömmüller","Simon Reith","Verena Rupprecht","Michael Sach","Sophia Schwaiger","Veronika Stiglmaier","Nikolas Thum","Julie A.
