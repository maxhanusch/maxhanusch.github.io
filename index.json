This led to the assumption that vicariance and geographic isolation play a major role in bryophyte speciation. More recently, when intraspecific morphological variation, long distance dispersal and low rates of molecular evolution in bryophytes became accepted among bryologists, a large number of locally distributed species were synonymized. As a result, many bryophyte species now show broad transcontinental geographic ranges, often with multiple disjunct distribution areas. _Epipterygium_ _tozeri_ (Bryaceae) is such a case, showing a holarctic distribution with disjunct areas in the western parts of North America, the Mediterranean and Central Asia. Collections from different geographic regions were first described as independent species, and later mostly lumped in E. tozeri based on morphology. Here, we contrast the morphological species concept in the genus _Epipterygium_ with molecular data. A combined analysis of one nuclear and two plastid loci was performed to assess species circumscriptions and distribution patterns and to reconstruct the historical biogeography in the E. tozeri complex.","tags":[],"title":"Integrative Taxonomy reveals new Macaronesian bryohphyte species","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1528243200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1528243200,"objectID":"82d9a919932eabbfc6afeab48f84b02f","permalink":"https://maxhanusch.github.io/talk/imoss_stpete/","publishdate":"2019-09-13T21:11:29+02:00","relpermalink":"/talk/imoss_stpete/","section":"talk","summary":"In the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, bryophyte species were seen as organisms with small distribution ranges and low variability.
